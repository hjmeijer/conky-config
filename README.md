About [Conky](http://conky.sourceforge.net/):

> Conky is a free, light-weight system monitor for X, that displays any information on your desktop. Conky is licensed under the GPL and runs on Linux and BSD.

This repo is a dump of my conky config files for easy reference. Iâ€™ve been inspired by [this thread](http://crunchbanglinux.org/forums/topic/59/my-conky-config/) in the [CrunchBang](http://crunchbanglinux.org/) forums and some other places on the web.

This screenshot shows three running instances of Conky:
* stats on the left
* clock in the upper right corner
* desktop indicator in the bottom right corner

You'll need the following fonts for the stats:
* [PizzaDude Bullets](http://www.dafont.com/pizzadude-bullets.font)
* [StyleBats](http://www.dafont.com/style-bats.font)

You'll need these fonts for the clock:
* [Existence](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Existence-Light)
* [Quicksand Light](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Quicksand)
